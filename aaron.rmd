<br> Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing

After collecting data from Glassnodes and CoinMetrics API, we did some data cleaning on Excel initially. This included changing variable names, sorting the excel, and adjusting for any discrepancies. After creating a compiled excel with both data sources, we imported it on Rstudio and formally begun the pre-processing. In the code below, we created 'Master' which is the final Excel after removing certain variables. These variables were removed based on our understanding of Blockchain, Bitcoin, and the Market Supply. If you look closely, we also removed variables that were in "native currency units" and kept everything in USD to standardize our findings.
